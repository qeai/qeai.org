### QEAI = Quantum Entanglement + Artificial Intelligence (Quantum Machine Learning)

Quantum Computing merges two great scientific revolutions of the 20th century: computer science and quantum physics.

Quantum physics is the theoretical basis of the transistor, the laser, and other technologies which enabled the computing revolution. But on the algorithmic level today's computing machinery still operates on "classical" Boolean logic.

Quantum computing is the design of hardware and software that replaces Boolean logic by quantum law at the algorithmic level. For certain computations such as optimization, sampling, search or quantum simulation this promises dramatic speedups.

I am (Tanase Laurentiu) particularly interested in applying quantum computing to artificial intelligence and machine learning. This is because many tasks in these areas rely on solving hard optimization problems or performing efficient sampling.
